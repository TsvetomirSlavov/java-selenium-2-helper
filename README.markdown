Selenium 2 Helper
=================

This small class contains some useful methods for Selenium 2 / WebDriver. I created this helper class while my three years work with the nice open source framework, Selenium 2 / WebDriver.

Usage
-----

Your PageObject classes extends from the SeleniumHelper class. Protected methods may be used in PageObjects; public methods in PageObjects and test methods by the PageObject object.
