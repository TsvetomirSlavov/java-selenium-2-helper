Selenium 2 Helper
=================

During my three years as test automation engineer I created this helper class for Selenium 2 / WebDriver.

Usage
-----

Your [PageObjects](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) can extend from the helper class. On this way you can use protected methods in your PageObjects and public methods in PageObjects and tests methods.
