Selenium 2 Utils
================

This small project contains some useful methods for Selenium 2 / WebDriver. I created this methods while my 2 1/2 years work with this nice open source testing framework.

Public and Protected
--------------------

Protected methods are only for PageObjects. Your PageObject classes extends from Functions.java and can use the methods, but not in tests.

Public methods are for PageObjects and tests. In tests you can use the methods about the PageObject class you use.

Notes
-----

Selenium 2 / WebDriver Version: `2.35.0`
